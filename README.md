# Sorting Visually

## Description

This is a sorting program that sorts colored lines based on height. This program can handle insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort. In the future, I hope to include more sorting algorithms.

## Getting Started

1. Firstly, clone the repository.
2. Make sure that a JDK is installed on your machine
3. To run the program, navigate to the Frame class and uncomment out the sorting method you want to run. Then, depending on the IDE used or command line, either click run if you are using with an IDE, or type `javac Frame.java` and then `java Frame.java` to compile and run the program.
